Matteo Corti <matteo.corti@id.ethz.ch> ETH Zurich

The original idea behind this script was from Neil Crellin.  It was updated
by Quanah Gibson-Mount to work with Nagios, and then further updated by Russ
Allbery <rra@stanford.edu> to support more standard options and to use a
more uniform coding style.

The script was then rewritten by Matteo Corti to be compatible with
embedded Perl, to allow the specification of a different port and to
integrate it with the Nagios::Plugin modules.
