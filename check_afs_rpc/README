check_afs_rpc is a Nagios plugin for checking AFS file servers to see if
there are client connections waiting for a free thread.  If there are more
than a few of these, AFS performance tends to be very slow; this is a fairly
reliable way to catch overloaded file servers.  By default, check_rxdebug
returns a critical error if there are more than eight connections waiting
for a free thread and a warning if there are more than two.  These
thresholds can be changed with the --critical and --warning options.

check_afs_rpc will always print out a single line of output including the
number of blocked connections, displaying whether this is critical, a
warning, or okay.
