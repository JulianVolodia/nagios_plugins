check_updates is a Nagios plugin to check if RedHat or Fedora system
is up-to-date

The plugin uses either YUM, DNF or up2date depending on the operating
system.

up2date:
========

since up2date -l to list the outdated packages can only be run be run
by root the plugin must be executed as root. Plese configure sudo as
follows:

  nagios ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/up2date -l

and execute the plugin with sudo

  sudo $INSTALLATION_PATH/check_updates

DNF:
====

DNF uses different caches pro user. This has the consequence that DNF
and the plugin will potentially deliver different results for
different users.
